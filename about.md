I am a software engineer on the WebSphere Compute Grid team. Our mission is to help enterprises manage their batch and online processing needs. Over the past few years, I have worked on several internal and external projects such as Lotus Greenhouse Labs, Smart Business, and most recently Java Batch JSR-352 which will be available in Java EE 7 release.

I am very involved in new Open Source technologies. I use GitHub as my public playground to learn and help the community.
